What is Megamoika?

Megamoika was a prominent car wash company in my hometown, working for over a decade at various locations. 
It comprised three sections: wet, dry, and parking. Employing 50 individuals, Megamoika boasted a substantial client base. 
The range of services offered included express, comprehensive, and contactless car washing, interior cleaning, polishing, and etc.

Why Megamoika?

Megamoika was a Ulan-Ude, Russia-based company that my father owned until November 2023 when the building unfortunately burned down. 
Having worked at Megamoika for a little while, I contemplated what kind of project I could undertake while still having access to valuable data. 
My experience with the company's insides pushed me to make my decision.

My Project

Primarily focused on Django Python and CSS skills, my project aims to be a full-stack website featuring a user system, a user-friendly interface, and a good backend and frontend. 
The website will also support two languages.
